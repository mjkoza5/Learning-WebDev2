Going though the process of developing my skills in HTML, CSS, and potentially Javascript.
ing

outline:
	1) index.html- This is the starting point. This page shows random HTML element along with links and boxes.

	2) page2.html - This page is more organized and cleaner. It lists basic information about HTML. It then
	gives several examples of HTML tages including Inline Element Tags and Table Tags.

	3) page3.html - This page is all about GIT. A rough and quick overview of how to get started using GIT from your terminal. Includes the basic commands to get started. At the end I input a link to a youtube video with more detail.

	4) page4.html - The CSS page. This page shows off some CSS style. First some basic info at the top then some screen shots showing how to implement your css page into your html pages.

	5) page5.html - The Javascript page. As you open the page you get several pop up boxes. Some displaying info and some asking for input. This is my start is Javascript.
